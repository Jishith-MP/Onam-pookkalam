This project represents my first attempt at creating a digital Pookkalam design using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Traditionally, Pookkalam is a floral arrangement created during the Onam festival, but this time I have taken the concept and transformed it into a web-based visual using coding techniques.

The design was built layer by layer, each representing different floral patterns. I used various shapes, colors, and structures to create the final layout, with JavaScript playing a key role in dynamically generating and positioning the elements.

This project gave me a valuable opportunity to blend cultural creativity with my frontend development skills, and I am grateful to Upcode for providing the platform to showcase this work.
